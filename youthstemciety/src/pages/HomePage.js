                <div className="founder-letter-text">
                  <p>
                  We are your founders, Anita, Elina, and Vanessa. We love empowering YOU(th)! We started with a simple idea: to make STEM education more accessible. As students ourselves, we saw many of our peers struggle to enjoy STEM because they faced constant barriers and were expected to learn from an uninspiring curriculum.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When we looked around our own communities, we noticed that so many young children, our siblings, cousins, and friends, felt disconnected from STEM. At first, we didnâ€™t understand why. Then it became clear: we had been exposed to STEM topics early on, which helped us grow our curiosity into something more, even a future career.                    
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Thatâ€™s why we created YouthSTEMciety, to break down those barriers and give every young person a chance to explore, create, and thrive in STEM.                    
                  </p>
                  <p>

                      We plan both in person and online events! We have events that last over a week, such as virtual internship programs, as well as workshops and activities that last about a day. These help foster a community of STEM enthusiasts from all ages and places!

                       Students can apply to be an executive for YSA every 4-5 months when we open hiring, or they can join as a general member. These members would assist with events and help create a welcoming community within our organization!
